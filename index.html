                        <h2>What is a cat?</h2>
                        <p>The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated
                            carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact.
